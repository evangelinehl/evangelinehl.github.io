            <p>In high school, I took a semester of web design and came to love the way we used code to put together elements of our own design into a full-fledged website. That was an impetus for me to eventually choose computer science as my course of study, leading to a career as a software engineer. That high school era blog about Taiwan, my parents' home island and my second home, has long since been taken offline, but I never lost that passion for designing creative projects like this. I found out that Github can host and deploy repos as websites--and I immediately got started coding a space for me to share photos, videos, and reflections and thoughts that cross my mind. This blog is the result.</p>

            <h1>photography</h1>  
            <p>In my childhood our family had a little point and shoot digital camera, and once I was old enough to handle the small device and manage the photos on the computer, perhaps around age 8 or 9, I loved the ability to make images of the world around me and record my memories that way. Even before that, I grew up going on hiking and camping trips with my family, and at home, I delighted in reading the kids' version of National Geographic and children's books showcasing the vibrant, cute, beautiful, fascinating wildlife and nature on this planet. That developed into a genuine love of photography as I got older. For me today, in addition to recording memories, it's a way to enjoy nature and live in the moment; photography often makes me notice various minute details of the scene around me that may otherwise escape my attention. Here I want to share some of this joy with you. I hope we can love and cherish nature together.</p>

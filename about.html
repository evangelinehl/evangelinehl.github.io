            <h1>about me</h1>  
            <p>My name is Evangeline. I'm a Taiwanese-American, born and raised in the USA. I'm a career software engineer but outside of professional obligations, I enjoy traveling, doing photography, reading, writing, immersing myself in nature, and occasionally making desserts and noodles to enjoy. My favorite type of environment is probably a clear glacial lake under towering mountains, but I also am happy seeing the waves come in on a beach, soaking up the peace of a forest, or even just watching (and usually photographing) a colorful bird from my perch standing next to a tree.</p>
